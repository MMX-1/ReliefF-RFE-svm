# ReliefF-RFE-svm
We propose a novel sparse SVM, named as ReliefF based on SVM, which combines recursive feature elimination (RFE) and ReliefF using a weight parameter. This new filter algorithm can capture relevant features and feature interactgions simultaneously and is crucial in preventing valuable features from being removed at each iteration.
